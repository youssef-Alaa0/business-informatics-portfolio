Lesson 14: Using DEFAULT Values

What I Did:
Sometimes a user doesn’t provide a value when inserting data. If we don’t want to leave it NULL, we can set a default value when creating the table.

Example:
create table dogs(name varchar(10) not null default 'unknown', age int not null);

not null makes sure the column can’t stay empty.

default 'unknown' means that if no value is provided, the word unknown will automatically be used.

Test:
insert into dogs(age) value(6);

Then when I check with select * from dogs;, the result is:

name	age
unknown	6

What I Learned:

Default values prevent empty or missing data.

They act as a fallback whenever no input is given.

Combined with not null, this ensures the table always has relevant, complete data.

Why It Matters in Business:
Defaults make sure systems keep running smoothly even if users forget to provide some information. For example, if someone signs up for a website without uploading a profile picture,
the system might assign a default image instead of leaving it blank. This keeps databases consistent and prevents errors in apps or reports.
