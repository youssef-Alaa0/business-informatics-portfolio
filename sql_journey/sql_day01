Databases Explained

A database system can be understood in three layers:

Database Server
This is the main machine or software that runs and manages multiple databases. For example, Microsoft could have a database server that stores many different databases at once.

Databases
Inside the server, you find the individual databases. Each one belongs to a company, app, or service. For example, Amazon might have one database, Netflix another.

Database Information (Tables/Schemas)
Within a database, the data itself is divided into different categories depending on what it’s used for. For example, Amazon’s database could include:

Users (customer accounts)

Payments (transactions)

Locations (warehouses, delivery addresses)

SQL Commands

In MySQL, to see all the databases on a server, you can use:

SHOW DATABASES;
