Lesson 13: Understanding NULL and NOT NULL

What I Did:
When we use show columns from <table name>;, we often see the word NULL marked with YES. This means the column allows unknown values.

NULL = unknown or missing value. If we don’t insert anything, the database will just leave it as NULL.

To prevent this, we can add NOT NULL when creating a table.

Example:
create table students(name varchar(10) not null, age int not null);

Now, if I try to insert only a name like this:
insert into students(name) values("mari");
→ This will lead to an error, because age was left unknown.

But if I insert both values:
insert into students(name, age) values("mari", 8);
→ The row gets added successfully, because no column is left NULL.

What I Learned:

NULL means “unknown value” — not zero, not empty, but literally unknown.

NOT NULL forces the database to always require a value in that column.

This ensures data completeness and avoids missing information.

Why It Matters in Business:
In real companies, allowing NULL can be risky. For example, in an orders table,
if the payment amount is NULL, the system can’t confirm if money was received.
Using NOT NULL ensures that essential fields (like payment amount or customer ID) can never be left blank. 
This prevents errors and keeps business records accurate.
