Lesson 7: Deleting a Table

Sometimes we donâ€™t need a table anymore, and in that case we can delete it completely.

The command to delete a table is: drop table <table name>;

For example: drop table buyers;

After running this command, the table will be removed from the database.

To make sure it was really deleted, we can check again using: show tables;
This will list all the tables in the database, and the deleted table will no longer appear.
