Lesson 8: Adding Comments

When writing SQL scripts, sometimes we want to leave notes or explanations that don’t actually run as commands. These are called comments.

Comments are ignored by the database system — they are only there as text for humans to read.

To write a comment, we use -- before the text.

Example:

-- hi my name is youssef and this is how to create a database
create database youssef;
-- now as you can see what took action was just "create database youssef"

In this example, the database only executes create database youssef; while the lines starting with -- are treated as comments and not executed.
