Lesson 9: Inserting Data into a Table

So far, we learned how to create empty tables, but an empty table is not very useful until we actually put data inside it. To add real data, we use the insert command.

The format is:

insert into <table name>(column1, column2) values(value1, value2);

For example, if we have a table called users with the columns name and age, we can insert one record like this:

insert into users(name, age) values("jack", 16);

This will create a new row in the users table, with jack as the name and 16 as the age.

Each time you use the insert command, you add one new record (row) into the table.
