Lesson 4: Introduction to Tables and Data Types

A database is made up of tables, and each table is built using different data types. While we wonâ€™t go into how to actually create a table in this lesson, we will look at two of the most important data types you need to understand first.

1.VARCHAR()

This is used for text, letters, or words.

The space inside the brackets ( ) is where you set the maximum number of characters allowed.

Example: varchar(30) means the text in this column can only be up to 30 characters long.

2.INT

This is used for numbers (whole numbers, not decimals).

Example: if a column is set as int, it can hold values like 1, 25, 300, etc.

Tables are basically a combination of these data types (and others) arranged in columns. Each column is given a specific type depending on what kind of data it will store.
