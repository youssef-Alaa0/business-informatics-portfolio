Lesson 16: Working with AUTO_INCREMENT

What I Did:
In the last lesson, I learned how to create a primary key to track rows of data. The problem was that I had to manually type the IDs (1, 2, 3…), which can be slow and unstable.

To fix this, I used the AUTO_INCREMENT command. This makes the database automatically assign the next number in sequence every time a new row is added.

Example:
create table shelter_dogs(id int auto_increment primary key, name varchar(14) not null default "unknown");

Now, when I insert data without providing an ID:
insert into shelter_dogs(name) values("mike");

Result when I select the table:

id	name
1	mike

The ID was automatically filled in. If I keep inserting more rows, the IDs will continue in order (2, 3, 4, …).

What I Learned:

AUTO_INCREMENT saves time by automatically numbering rows.

It prevents errors that happen when trying to assign IDs manually.

It keeps data organized and consistent.

Why It Matters in Business:
Organizations use AUTO_INCREMENT for stability and accuracy. For example, payment transactions, order numbers, or customer IDs all need to be unique and in order. If these were entered manually, mistakes would happen. AUTO_INCREMENT solves this problem and makes large systems much more reliable.
