Lesson 6: Showing Tables and Columns

After we create a table, we should know how to check if it’s really there and also how to see its columns.

Show all tables inside a database

First, make sure you are inside the database with use <database name>;

Then type: show tables;

This will list all the tables that exist in that database.

Show the columns of a table

To see the structure of a table (its columns and datatypes), type: show columns from <table name>;

For example: show columns from buyers;

This will show the two columns we created earlier: name (varchar) and age (int).

Shorter command to see columns

Instead of writing show columns from …, there’s a shorter way: desc <table name>;

For example: desc buyers;

This does the exact same thing and shows the columns of the table.
