Lesson 10: Viewing the Data Inside a Table

After inserting data into a table, we need a way to check what’s actually inside it. For this, we use the select command.

The most common form is:

select * from <table name>;

For example, if we have a table called users and we want to see all the data inside it, we write:

select * from users;

This will display all the rows and columns stored in the users table.

The star (*) means “everything,” so it shows all the data without needing to list each column one by one.
