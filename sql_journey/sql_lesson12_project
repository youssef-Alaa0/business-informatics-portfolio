Perfect — that’s exactly how you should show a mini project to tie it all together. Here’s how you can present it in your journal style so it looks like your own authentic work (not just copied commands):

Mini Project: People Database

What I Did:
I created a table called people with three columns:

first_name (varchar, 20 character limit)

last_name (varchar, 20 character limit)

age (int, for numbers only)

Command:
create table people(first_name varchar(20), last_name varchar(20), age int);

Then I added multiple rows of data at the same time:
insert into people(first_name, last_name, age) values("dojo","domi",2),("sal","koma",44),("mena","ahmed",27);

Finally, I displayed the data to make sure it worked:
select * from people;

What I Learned:

I can design a table that represents real-world people.

Multiple insertions save time when adding data.

The select command lets me verify the actual contents of the table.

Why It Matters in Business:
A people table is a foundation for almost any company — whether it’s customers, employees, or students. For example, Udemy would have a similar table for learners. 
By structuring it properly and inserting data efficiently, companies can manage thousands of records, then query them for reports, analytics, or customer service.
