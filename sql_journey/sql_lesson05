Lesson 5: Creating a Table

Before we can create a table, we first need to make sure we are inside the database we want to use. We do this with the command: use <database name>;

Once the database is selected, we can create a table with the command:

create table <table name>(column name datatype, column name datatype);

For example, if I want to make a table called buyers with two columns (name and age), I would write:

create table buyers(name varchar(10), age int);

Here, name is stored as varchar(10), which means the name can only be up to 10 letters long.

age is stored as int, which means it accepts whole numbers.

Extra note: In most cases, for text or words we use varchar, and for numbers we use int.
