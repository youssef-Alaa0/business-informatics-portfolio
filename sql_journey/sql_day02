Lesson 2: Creating a Database

In the previous lesson, we learned how to list all the databases inside a server using:

SHOW DATABASES;


Now let’s go one step further and actually create a new database.

The command is:

CREATE DATABASE <name>;


For example, let’s say I have a company called Udemy and I want to create a database for it. I would type:

CREATE DATABASE udemy;


Once the command runs, MySQL will add the new database to the server.

To make sure it’s really there, we can run the command we learned before:

SHOW DATABASES;


This will list all the databases again, and now you should see udemy included in the list.
